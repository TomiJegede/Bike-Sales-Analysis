# Bike Sales Analysis Project

This project involves analyzing customer behavior and trends in bike purchases. Using a dataset provided by [AlexTheAnalyst](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Excel-Tutorial), the analysis identifies key factors influencing bike purchasing decisions.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project was to explore and derive actionable insights from the dataset by cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the data. The results aim to help businesses understand customer preferences and improve marketing strategies.

## Data Cleaning
The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accuracy and usability:
- Removed duplicate rows.
- Standardized categorical values (e.g., `M -> Male`, `S -> Single`).
- Added a new column, `Age Brackets`, to categorize customers into groups (e.g., `Young`, `Adult`, `Senior`).

## Analysis Highlights
1. **Income Trends**:
   - Higher-income individuals are more likely to purchase bikes.

2. **Age Brackets**:
   - Adults (31–59 years) are the largest bike-buying demographic.

3. **Commute Distance**:
   - Customers with shorter commutes (0–1 miles) purchase the most bikes.

4. **Car Ownership**:
   - Households with fewer cars (0–2) purchase more bikes, indicating a substitution effect.

5. **Occupational Insights**:
   - Professionals and skilled manual workers are more inclined to purchase bikes.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**:
  - Data Cleaning and Transformation
  - Pivot Tables
  - Data Visualization (Graphs and Charts)

## Insights and Recommendations
- Focus marketing on mid-income adults with short commutes.
- Promote eco-friendly and cost-effective benefits of bikes.
- Tailor campaigns regionally to optimize impact.
